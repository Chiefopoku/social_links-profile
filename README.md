### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="gh">
        <a href="https://github.com/Chiefopoku">GitHub</a>
</div>
```
```css
gh a:hover,
.fm a:hover,
.ig a:hover,
.link a:hover,
.x a:hover {
    color: rgb(84, 73, 73); 
    background-color: rgba(233, 222, 222, 0.3); 
    border-radius: 5px; 
}
```


### Continued development

I look forward to improving my knowledge in custom css and improving readability of my code



### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/positioning-content/) - This helped me with positioning of divs and other css customizations. I really liked the information and study guide provided by this site and will use it going forward.
- [resource 2](https://www.codecademy.com/) - This is an amazing website with tons of resources and practice guides which helped me finally understand html tags. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
